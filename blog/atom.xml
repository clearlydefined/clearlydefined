<p>The ClearlyDefined community had an important presence at the event, represented by E. Lynette Rayle and Lukas Spieß from GitHub and Qing Tomlinson from SAP. I had the pleasure to represent the Open Source Initiative as the community manager for ClearlyDefined. The mission of ClearlyDefined is to crowdsource a global database of licensing metadata for every software component ever published. We see the ORT community as an important partner towards achieving this mission.</p>
