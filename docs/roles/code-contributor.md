Are you a Node, React, Python, or cloud dev who loves working on
far-reaching, impactful projects? How about simplifying complex tasks
at scale? Do you enjoy enabling people and teams be more successful
with their passions? Have you spent a bunch of time working on
Open Source projects at work or for fun?

If so, you're a great fit for ClearlyDefined, a community of people
coming together to generate better metadata for FOSS projects. Weâ€™d love to
hear more about your knowledge and interest, and see how you can make
an impact on the whole industry.

We're on a mission to help FOSS projects thrive by being, well, more
clearly defined. Lack of clarity around licenses and security
vulnerabilities reduces engagement -- that means fewer users, fewer
contributors and a smaller community. This is a community-wide
challenge and we're taking a community-wide approach.

We want to:

- Raise awareness within FOSS project teams
- Make it easy to identify and supply missing information
- Automatically harvest data from projects
- Crowd-source the curation that data
- Feed the curation work back to the original projects

Your role is to drive the technology and infrastructure that supports
the project. As a Developer, you will:

- Build domain knowledge in Open Source licensing and security.
- Show a real passion for detail.
- Write code in JavaScript, Python, and lots of other tech that runs
  in the cloud on using Node, React, and more.
- Work with massive datasets (all of opensource).
- Work with a wide variety of people across many communities.
- Gain the undying gratitude of Open Source producers and consumers.
- Be fully transparent in all your work.

ClearlyDefined is a diverse and inclusive community of technical experts
who are passionate about quality FOSS. If you or a colleague are
