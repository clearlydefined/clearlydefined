Are you often frustrated when you use FOSS code and can’t find the
license or copyright holders so that you can do disclosure and
attribution? Do you wish there was an easy way to get
the data you need to be compliant? Are you worried when you start to
use FOSS components that have ambiguous metadata?

If so, you'll love ClearlyDefined, a community of people coming
together to generate better metadata for FOSS projects. We’d love to
work with you to hook our systems up to your workflow.

At ClearlyDefined, we're on a mission to help FOSS projects thrive by
being, well, more clearly defined. Lack of clarity around licenses and
security vulnerabilities reduces engagement -- that means fewer users,
fewer contributors and a smaller community. This is a community-wide
challenge and we're taking a community-wide approach.

We want to:

- Raise awareness within FOSS project teams
- Make it easy to identify and supply missing information
- Automatically harvest data from projects
- Crowd-source the curation of that data
- Feed the curated work back to the original projects

We are building a clearing house of FOSS metadata and we’d like you to
consider consuming that data. If you are using FOSS code now, it may
be the case that you are already doing some of your own scanning and
discovery of license metadata for yourself. ClearlyDefined can
provide some of the data you need so you don’t have to do all this
work on your own anymore. Even better, the data is curated by a broad
community. As a consumer you get API access to harvested and curated
data on a range of FOSS projects.

ClearlyDefined is a diverse and inclusive community of technical experts
who are passionate about quality FOSS. If you or a colleague are
