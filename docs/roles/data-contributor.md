Are you a data scientist, librarian, or just love finding and
organizing data? Do you enjoy helping people and teams be more
successful with their passions? Have you spent a bunch of time working
on opensource projects at work or for fun? Do you know about
opensource licenses and what they require when using opensource?

If so, you're a great fit for ClearlyDefined, a community of people
gathering and curating data about open source components. Weâ€™d love to
hear more about your knowledge and interest, and see how you can make
an impact on the whole industry.

We're on a mission to help FOSS projects thrive by being, well, more
clearly defined. Lack of clarity around licenses and security
vulnerabilities reduces engagement -- that means fewer users, fewer
contributors and a smaller community. This is a community-wide
challenge and we're taking a community-wide approach.

- Raise awareness within FOSS project teams
- Make it easy to identify and supply missing information
- Automatically harvest data from projects
- Crowd-source the curation that data
- Feed the curation work back to the original projects

Your role is to drive this hands-on, collaborative process. As a
Curator, you will:

- Build domain knowledge in opensource licensing and security
  vulnerabilities.
- Show a real passion for detail.
- Identify issues in the data and create resolutions.
- Develop expertise in running the tools used to detect and analyze
  components.
- Work with upstream teams to incorporate the curated data into their
  projects.
- Work with a wide variety of people across many communities.
- Work on many things at once
- Gain the undying gratitude of opensource producers and consumers
- Be fully transparent in all your work

ClearlyDefined is a diverse and inclusive community of technical experts
who are passionate about quality FOSS. If you or a colleague are
