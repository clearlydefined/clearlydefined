# Get involved

ClearlyDefined is very early in its life. There are lots of areas to explore and develop,
decisions to be made, implementation to be done, and communities to be engaged. Just about
anyone from Dev to Lawyer to Designer to Community manager has something to get from or
contribute to ClearlyDefined.

Below are a few examples how to get involved. If you think of something else, by all means,
reach out to the community on one of these mediums:

* GitHub -- [github.com/clearlydefined](https://github.com/clearlydefined)
* Discord -- [discord.gg/wEzHJku](https://discord.gg/wEzHJku)
* Twitter -- [twitter.com/clearlydefd](https://twitter.com/clearlydefd)
* Email -- [clearlydefined@googlegroups.com](mailto:clearlydefined@googlegroups.com)

## Using the data

The absolutely simplest thing you can do to get involved is to use the data in ClearlyDefined.
The set of data available is growing by the minute so if something is missing today, it
might be there tomorrow. If a whole class or community of components is messing, perhaps you'd
like to pitch and [contribute some code](#contribute-code) to support your domain. Either way,
the [data user's guide](using-data) has information on how to get and understand the data in
ClearlyDefined. Check out the [mock job posting for data consumers](roles/data-consumer).

## Adopt

Projects can _adopt_ ClearlyDefined practices by ensuring that the information for their
components shows up correctly in ClearlyDefined's definitions. If information is missing or
incorrect, it means the tools we use could not figure it out. Could be we need better tools
or that a hint or two from you could point the tools in the right direction. Check out
the [adopter doc](adopting) for more info on ensuring your components are clearly defined.
Check out the [mock job posting for project adopters](roles/adopter).

## Contribute data

If you are like hundreds of others, you may spend a bunch of time figuring out the
exact source code commit for a component version, or the license or attribution details for
a compoenent. Wouldn't it be great if you could share that with folks or find information
that others have discovered? Head over to the [data contribution guide](contributing-data)
to learn more about enhancing the data in ClearlyDefined. Check out the [mock job posting
for data contributors](roles/data-contributor).

## Curate data

The ClearlyDefined tools are not perfect and not all projects have the data folks need. Thankfully
there are people out there [contributing data](#contribute-data). Like any open source project
these contributions need to be vetted, discussed and merged. That's what _curators_ do.
If you understand free and open source software licensing and have a pension for 'getting it
right', you are a perfect candidate to be a curator. The [data curation guide](data-curation)
has more information on the role, the processes and the tools for curating data. Check out the
[mock job posting for data curators](roles/data-curator).

## Contribute code

ClearlyDefined is all about the data but there is a non-trivial service and website that makes
it all happen. Whether you are a backend cloud kinda dev, a front-end UI hacker, UX designer,
or graphic artist, there are many opportunities to make an impact. The current system is done
with Node and React and is just an example of where we're headed. Imagine a system that harness
100s (1000s) of cores to scan the world's open source and then analyze and present it to the
entire community while enabling simple contribution and curation workflows and change upstreaming
to communities from Debian to Node. Yeah, there's lots to do. Check out the [code contribution
guide](contributing-code) and what appeals to you. Also take a look at the
[mock job posting for code contributor](roles/code-contributor).

## Donate data

Many organizations already have a stash of curated data relating to the components they produce or
use. That's awesome. You can contribute that to ClearlyDefined and help kickstart the community
in an area you care about. Even if 'all' you've done is figured out the source location/commit
that matches a given component version, that's a huge start. Or perhaps you've nailed down the
contributor list or clarified some licenses. It's all good. Take a look at the [data donation
guide](data-donation) for information on donating data you already have. You should also look at
[contributing any new data](#contribute-data) you discover on an ongoing basis.

## Donate compute

All this data harvesting and analysis takes compute. The ClearlyDefined harvester agent run as a
relatively simple Docker container that pulls a request from a queue, processes the request and
returns the resultant data. This option is not for everyone. We have some security requirements
etc. to help ensure the integrity of the system. If you have a healthy chunk of cores sitting
around that can be used to run Docker in a secure environment, we're certainly interested. Signal
your interest by dropping an email to [clearlydefined](mailto:clearlydefined@outlook.com).

## Donate money

Often it is easiest for people to simply donate money to support this work. No problem. ClearlyDefined
operates as part of the Open Source Initiative, a 501c3 (US charity). When you support the OSI you are
able to direct your funds to support the ClearlyDefined work. Details of how to get money to the OSI
are given in the [OSI donation guide](donate-osi).
