# ClearlyDefined Privacy Policy

ClearlyDefined is an [Open Source Initiative](https://www.opensource.org) (OSI) project. This document sets out the privacy policy for the ClearlyDefined website and associate services (“Website”).

By using the Website, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue accessing or otherwise using the Website and any services provided on it.

## How We Use Your Data

We may use non-personal aggregated data to improve the experience, usability, and content of the Website. Except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not collect or store personal data about you.

## Types of Data We Collect

ClearlyDefined may collect and analyze non-personal data to evaluate how visitors use the Website. ClearlyDefined may use information you provide, including authentication information, to enable the features and functions of the Website and its interaction with third party service.

<b>Aggregate Data.</b> We may gather aggregate data, which refers to information your computer automatically provides to us and which cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples include referral data (the websites you visited just before and just after the Website), the Website pages viewed, time spent at the Website, and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. For example, when you request a page from the Website, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns and for purposes of system administration.

<b>Log Files.</b> Every time you request or download a file from the Website we may store data about these events and your IP address in a log file. We may use this data to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use or for other purposes.

<b>Cookies.</b> The Website may use a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies are small packets of information that a website stores on your computer. The Website can then read the cookies whenever you visit the Website. We may use cookies in several ways, such as to save a token so that you do not have to enter your GitHub username and password each time you visit the Website.

Most browser software can be set up to handle cookies. You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, certain functions and conveniences of the Website may not work properly, and you may be unable to use those Website services that require registration to participate, or you will have to re-enter your username and password each time you visit the Website. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar.

## Analytics

We use analytics tools to collect information about use of this site. Those tools collect information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from these tools only to improve this site. We do not combine the information collected by these tools with personally identifiable information. Although these tools may plant a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but the tool provider and is governed by their respective policies.
