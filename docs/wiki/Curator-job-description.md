Are you a data scientist, librarian, or just love finding and
organizing data? Do you enjoy helping people and teams be more
successful with their passions? Have you spent a bunch of time working
on opensource projects at work or for fun? Do you know about
opensource licenses and what they require when using opensource?

If so, you're a great fit for ClearlyDefined, a community of people
gathering and curating data about open source components. We’d love to
hear more about your knowledge and interest, and see how you can make
an impact on the whole industry.

We're on a mission to help FOSS projects thrive by being, well, more
clearly defined. Lack of clarity around licenses and security
vulnerabilities reduces engagement -- that means fewer users, fewer
contributors and a smaller community. This is a community-wide
challenge and we're taking a community-wide approach.

* Raise awareness within FOSS project teams

* Make it easy to identify and supply missing information

* Automatically harvest data from projects

* Crowd-source the curation that data

* Feed the curation work back to the original projects

Your role is to drive this hands-on, collaborative process. As a
Curator, you will:

* Build domain knowledge in opensource licensing and security
  vulnerabilities.

* Show a real passion for detail.

* Identify issues in the data and create resolutions.

* Develop expertise in running the tools used to detect and analyze
  components.

* Work with upstream teams to incorporate the curated data into their
  projects.

* Work with a wide variety of people across many communities.

* Work on many things at once

* Gain the undying gratitude of opensource producers and consumers

* Be fully transparent in all your work

ClearlyDefined is a diverse and inclusive community technical experts
who are passionate about quality opensource.  If you or a colleague
