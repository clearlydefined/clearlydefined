Are you a representative of an open source project that’s working hard
on making sure your licensing and copyright holders for your project
are available and unambiguous? Would you like to make the information
more publicly discoverable so that other people will use your open
source project?

If so, we think you would be a likely project adopter for
ClearlyDefined, a community of people gathering and curating data
about open source components. We’d love to work with you on running
our tools over your code base and seeing how ClearlyDefined you are.

We are building a clearinghouse of data about open source projects so
that consumers of those projects will be able to use them with
confidence. You can help build your project’s success while also
helping us build our understanding of the FOSS ecosystem by adopting
ClearlyDefined.

By adopting, you are agreeing to:

* Have the ClearlyDefined tools run over your codebase

* Have your project metadata in a format that is easily digestible by
  tools for discovering metadata (Scan Code, Fossology)

* Accept curations of data that should be less ambiguous from the
  community of curators familiar with this subject area

We're on a mission to help FOSS projects thrive by being, well, more
clearly defined. Lack of clarity around licenses and security
vulnerabilities reduces engagement -- that means fewer users, fewer
contributors and a smaller community. This is a community-wide
challenge and we're taking a community-wide approach.

* Raise awareness within FOSS project teams

* Make it easy to identify and supply missing information

* Automatically harvest data from projects

* Crowd-source the curation that data

* Feed the curation work back to the original projects

ClearlyDefined is a diverse and inclusive community technical experts
who are passionate about quality open source. If you or a colleague or
your organization is interested in learning more, check out
