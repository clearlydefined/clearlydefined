# Roadmap 2024

There are three major pillars for ClearlyDefined technical work.

![Three Pillars of the Technical Roadmap](/img/technical-roadmap-3-pillars.png)

## Data Quality

### License Data Quality

- reduce missing licenses
  - pass through ScanCode LicenseRef
  - reduce the number of licenses identified as NOASSERTION/OTHER
- accurate license data
  - improve the human curation process for licenses
  - report of complex licenses to identify licenses for human review
- improve license coverage by adding support for more package managers with potential candidates...
  - Dartâ€™s pub
  - GitHub Actions
  - Support for purl (in search)
  - identify additional package managers

### Attributions Data Quality

- accurate attribution data
  - improve the human curation process for attributions
  - report of attributions not following the expected pattern to identify attributions for human review

### UI Usability Improvements

- redesign UI (e.g. functional workflows for curations, searching for definitions)
- implement proposed UI design
- bug fixes

_NOTE: Curations through the UI lead directly to data quality improvements._

## Performance

### Improve Crawler Throughput

- determine the cause of current poor performance
- explore improvements to concurrency in code
- determine level of horizontal scaling needed to support demand on the queue
- support other entities setting up crawlers on their hardware
- update queue processing to support a secondary queue set that a crawler draws from when their primary queue is empty
- add better monitoring, examples...
  - alerts when crawler requests fail at a rate > 10 per hour
  - alerts when crawler queue size > 1 million
  - alerts when harvest queue processes < 3 requests in an hour
  - count of requests processed per hour
  - count of requests failing per hour
  - count of requests that timeout

### Improve API Performance

- support higher rate limits for API requests
- explore why requests are denied before current rate limits are met

## Sustainability

### Code Sustainability

- keep license detection tools on the latest version
- regular dependency updates

### DevOps & Infrastructure

- make it easier to deploy at a more frequent cadence
  - move deploys to GitHub Actions
  - document release and deploy process
  - expand integration tests
  - document manual checks to perform after a deploy
- evaluate current hardware to determine if upgrades are needed

### Documentation

- modernize current documentation by moving to Docusaurus

### Collaborators

- identify potential collaborators
- establish good issue management
  - add issues for roadmap items
  - triage older issues, closing as appropriate
  - add `Good First Issue` label to appropriate issues

## Requested and Considering

- trust score for license human curations where score increases with the number of institutions that have reviewed the data

# Community Objectives

These are the main objectives for 2024:

1. Bring back a unified vision for ClearlyDefined where the community is heard and can participate in.

- Key result 1: Double number of players in the community by end of the year
  - 2023: Microsoft, SAP, Bloomberg
  - 2024: +GitHub, Stacklok, JetBrains, Codethink, Kusari ?
- Key result 2: Double community contributions on GitHub by end of the year

2. Work closely together with various other organizations, including the ORT, TODO Group, OSPO++, OSPO Alliance, OpenChain, SPDX, GUAC, Eclipse Foundation, and Software Heritage, to promote ClearlyDefined. Work closely together with OpenSSF.

- Key result 1: Triple the number of organizations we are involved with
  - 2023: OpenChain, ORT
  - 2024: +OpenSSF, Eclipse Foundation, GUAC, Software Heritage, TODO Group
- Key result 2: Increase activities (webinars, events, blog posts) with various organizations by 100%
