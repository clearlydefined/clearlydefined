  "description": "Being ClearlyDefined is about clarity in different domains of a component. For example, we talk about being ClearlyDescribed as meaning that the essential descriptive data about a component (e.g., source location) is available. Similarly, being ClearlyLicensed means that the key license-related data (e.g., license and attribution parties) are readily apparent. The set of domains coordinated by ClearlyDefined will evolve over time. The current set are detailed below.",
