  "description": "As a community manager, I find FOSS Backstage to be one of my favorite conferences content-wise and community-wise. This is a conference that happens every year in Berlin, usually in early March. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to meet community leaders from Europe and across the world with the goal of fostering discussions around three complementary perspectives: a) community health and growth, b) project governance and sustainability, and c) supply chain compliance and security.",
