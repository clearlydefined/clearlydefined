  "description": "At the beginning of 2023, I started as a community manager for ClearlyDefined, with the goals of creating an open governance model for the project and helping the OSI to establish a neutral infrastructure to foster collaboration among multiple stakeholders. Thanks to the amazing work from our community members, a lot of progress has been made in 2023, but thereâ€™s still a lot of work ahead of us. In this post, we would like to highlight some milestones achieved this past year and acknowledge some individuals who have contributed to the project. We would also like to share a vision for 2024 and invite all organizations who care about the Open Source supply chain to become involved.",
