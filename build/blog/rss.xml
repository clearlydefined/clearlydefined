            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again Bosch’s campus in Berlin received ORT Community Days, the annual event organized by the OSS Review Toolkit (ORT) community. ORT is an Open Source suite of tools to automate software compliance checks.</p>
<p>The ClearlyDefined community had an important presence at the event, represented by E. Lynette Rayle and Lukas Spieß from GitHub and Qing Tomlinson from SAP. I had the pleasure to represent the Open Source Initiative as the community manager for ClearlyDefined. The mission of ClearlyDefined is to crowdsource a global database of licensing metadata for every software component ever published. We see the ORT community as an important partner towards achieving this mission.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[At the beginning of 2023, I started as a community manager for ClearlyDefined, with the goals of creating an open governance model for the project and helping the OSI to establish a neutral infrastructure to foster collaboration among multiple stakeholders. Thanks to the amazing work from our community members, a lot of progress has been made in 2023, but there’s still a lot of work ahead of us. In this post, we would like to highlight some milestones achieved this past year and acknowledge some individuals who have contributed to the project. We would also like to share a vision for 2024 and invite all organizations who care about the Open Source supply chain to become involved.]]></description>
